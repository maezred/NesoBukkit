## Overview

${project.name} links the whitelist using your database:

  - When TNT is explodes near other TNT, it's primed at a configurable rate
    - Default is enabled with 25 TNT primed per second
  - TNT can be configured to not damage the environment
    - Default is enabled
  - TNT can be placed and ignited in protected regions (combine with previous option for some fun)
    - Default is also enabled (isn't that the point of this?)
  - TNT can instantly explode; skipping the priming phase
    - Default is enabled if the TNT is dense.


All features are fully configurable.

Source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/moltendorf/${project.name}).
